Certainly! Here is a two-page, beginner-friendly explanation of your BSQ project, its structure, compilation, and how the main logic flows. You can copy this into a README.txt or similar file.

BSQ Project: How It Works
1. Project Overview
This project solves the "Biggest Square" (BSQ) problem:
Given a map (as a text file or from standard input), the program finds the largest possible square that can be placed on the map without overlapping any obstacles, and marks it.

The project is split into several .c files, each handling a specific part of the logic, and a Makefile to automate compilation.

2. Makefile Structure and Compilation
The Makefile is a script that tells the compiler how to build your program.
Key parts:

SRC: Lists all the .c source files (main, parser, solver, utils, etc.).
OBJS: Lists the corresponding .o object files (compiled but not yet linked).
CC: The compiler (usually gcc).
CFLAGS: Compiler flags for warnings and includes.
all: The default rule, builds the program.
clean/fclean: Remove object files and the executable.
re: Rebuild everything from scratch.
norm: Runs Norminette for code style checking.
How compilation works:

Each .c file is compiled into a .o object file.
All .o files are linked together to create the final executable (bsq).
The -I include flag tells the compiler to look for header files in the include directory.
3. Key Files and Their Roles
main.c: Entry point; handles input and output flow.
map_parser.c: Reads and parses the map file or stdin, builds the internal map structure.
solver.c: Contains the algorithm to find the biggest square.
printer.c: Handles outputting the final map with the square marked.
utils.c, utils_2.c, utils_3.c, utils_4.c: Helper functions for memory, parsing, and map management.
bsq.h: Header file with structure definitions and function prototypes.
4. How the Program Works (Step by Step)
A. Program Start (main.c)
The program starts in main().
If arguments are given, it treats each as a map file and processes them one by one.
If no arguments, it reads from standard input.
B. Map Creation and Parsing
For each map, ft_create_map() is called (from map_parser.c).
This function:
Allocates a t_map structure.
Opens the file (or uses stdin).
Calls parse_header() to read the map's first line (to get row count and map symbols).
Allocates the matrix for the map.
Reads the map data into the matrix.
C. Solving the Map
Once the map is loaded, ft_process_map() (from printer.c) is called.
This function calls ft_get_square() (from solver.c), which:
Uses dynamic programming to fill the matrix with the size of the largest square ending at each cell.
Tracks the largest square found.
D. Output
After solving, ft_process_map() prints the map, marking the largest square with the "full" character.
If there are multiple maps, a newline is printed between outputs.
5. Key Functions and Their Connections
ft_create_map: Orchestrates map reading and matrix allocation.
parse_header: Reads the first line to get map size and symbols.
allocate_matrix: Allocates memory for the map's matrix.
ft_read_matrix_line: Reads each line of the map into the matrix.
ft_get_square: The core solver; finds the biggest square using the matrix.
ft_process_map: Calls the solver and prints the result.
Helpers (in utils files) handle:

Memory allocation (ft_realloc, ft_memcpy)
String and number parsing (ft_atoi, ft_strcmp, is_number)
File operations (open_map_fd)
Error handling (ft_map_error, ft_free_map)
6. How Everything Connects
main.c decides where to get the map (file or stdin).
map_parser.c reads and parses the map, building the internal matrix.
solver.c finds the largest possible square.
printer.c prints the map with the square marked.
utils files provide all the small helper functions needed by the above.
7. Summary
The Makefile automates building all parts into one program.
The program reads a map, parses it, solves for the biggest square, and prints the result.
Each .c file has a clear role, and helpers are split for Norminette compliance.
The main logic flow is: input → parse → solve → output.
This structure makes the code modular, maintainable, and easy to extend or debug.
